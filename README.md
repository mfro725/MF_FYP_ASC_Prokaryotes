# MF_FYP_ASC_Prokaryotes

Scripts and files for the associated FYP carrying out comprehensive analysis of stop codon usage in 728 bacterial and archaic genomes:  "Like evidence has suggested in eukaryotes, do prokaryotes select for fail safe stop codons?"


This repository contains the source code for running the analysis described in the project.

====================================================================================

**Instructions:**

• All files ran from root directory

• Scripts are labelled numerically in chronological order of methodology conducted (1 to 26)


**EMBL files:**

• archea_filtered_genomes

• bacterial_filtered_genomes

**Python/R scripts:**

A spreadsheet with more detailed script information (Python and R) can be found in the document 'scripts_explained'.

26.	Statistical analysis (paired t test) and representation of observed TGT and TGG rates vs null 2 and 3 (NCDS and OOF) histogram (appendix 2)

**FASTA folders/files explained:**

The working repository contains 3 folders of FASTA files:

• UTR_CDS: This folder contains FASTA files for filtered bacteria dataset. Sequences contained in the FASTA files are the 3’ UTR of protein coding sequences with information for all qualifying genes that satisfy filters.

• UTR_NCDS: This folder contains FASTA files for filtered bacteria dataset. Sequences contained in the FASTA files are the 3’ UTR of non-protein coding sequences with information for all qualifying genes that satisfy filters.

• UTR_OOF: This folder contains FASTA files for filtered bacteria dataset. Sequences contained in the FASTA files are the 3’ UTR of non-protein coding sequences with information for all qualifying genes that satisfy filters.
